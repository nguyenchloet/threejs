## first, I built a scene 

## then I created a character in blender

## next, I added the character to the scene - on top of the world as well as on a flat plane moving via keypress

## next steps
- moving the character along the sphere
- adding animation in blender
- adding other objects to the world
- changing camera angle based on character position
- world interaction
